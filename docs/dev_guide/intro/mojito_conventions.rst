==================
Mojito Conventions
==================


MVC
===

Your models, controllers, and views in Mojito applications are in your mojit directories
in the following location:

- ``mojits/{mojit_name}/models/``
- ``mojits/{mojit_name}/``
- ``mojits/{mojit_name}/views/``

File Names
==========

Controllers
-----------

The default controller file is ``controller.{affinity}.js``, but you can define the 

.. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
   :header: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 10, 30

   "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
   "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
   crunchy, now would it?"
   "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"
